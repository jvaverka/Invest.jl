## Introduction

**Investment science** is the application of scientific tools to investments.

## Terminology

Expenditures and receipts are denominated in cash, and these net receipts at any
time period are termed **cash flow**. Any series of flows over several periods
are called **cash flow streams**.

So cash flow streams are how we quantify currency over time. The best way to
determine _which_ investment route to take is by comparing two potential cash
flow streams. This is the main principle to investing, and we call it the
**comparison principle**.

Wouldn't it be great if you could earn money without investing anything at all.
Well sometimes you can, and it's called **arbitrage**. Since this is _very_
rare, for analysis purposes it is assumed that no such opportunity exists - a
**no arbitrage** assumption is made.
